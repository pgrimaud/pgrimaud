Glad to see you :smile:.

## I need you to participate to a cool experiment.

I plan to create a wall mural with GitHub profile pictures and redraw a masterpiece with avatars as small parts. :art:

**But I will not add random people without permission, so if you're agree to participate: you just have to star this repository. Easy, isn't it?** Why you need to star to participate? Because it will be very easy to retrieve all avatars with the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/starring/#list-stargazers).

At the moment, I have not define the painting to draw, I think about the famous **"The Creation of Adam"** from Michelangelo.

More to come...

Thanks :pray:
